"""Tell search engines that pages changed, instead of waiting to be crawled.

IndexNow: participating engines share submissions with each other, so one ping
reaches Bing (and therefore DuckDuckGo and ChatGPT's search) plus the rest.
Google does not participate — it is reached through the sitemap and Search
Console, which is why both exist.

    python3 notify.py /blog/slug/     # submit specific paths

Ownership is proven by the <key>.txt file in the site root; do not delete it.
